Of a German and ancient line,
I dedicate undying
Faith to this land of mine.
A prince I am, undaunted,
Of Orange, ever free,
To the king of Spain I've granted
A lifelong loyalty.

I've ever tried to live in
The fear of God's command
And therefore I've been driven,
From people, home, and land,
But God, I trust, will rate me
His willing instrument
And one day reinstate me
Into my government.

Let no despair betray you,
My subjects true and good.
The Lord will surely stay you
Though now you are pursued.
He who would live devoutly
Must pray God day and night
To throw His power about me
As champion of your right.

Life and my all for others
I sacrificed, for you!
And my illustrious brothers
Proved their devotion too.
Count Adolf, more's the pity,
Fell in the Frisian fray,
And in the eternal city
Awaits the judgement day.

I, nobly born, descended
From an imperial stock.
An empire's prince, defended
(Braving the battle's shock
Heroically and fearless
As pious Christian ought)
With my life's blood the peerless
Gospel of God our Lord.

A shield and my reliance,
O God, Thou ever wert.
I'll trust unto Thy guidance.
O leave me not ungirt.
That I may stay a pious
Servant of Thine for aye
And drive the plagues that try us
And tyranny away.

My God, I pray thee, save me
From all who do pursue
And threaten to enslave me,
Thy trusted servant true.
O Father, do not sanction
Their wicked, foul design,
Don't let them wash their hands in
This guiltless blood of mine.

O David, thou soughtest shelter
From King Saul's tyranny.
Even so I fled this welter
And many a lord with me.
But God the Lord did save me
From exile and its hell
And, in His mercy, gave him
A realm in Israel.

Fear not 't will rain sans ceasing
The clouds are bound to part.
I bide that sight so pleasing
Unto my princely heart,
Which is that I with honor
Encounter death in war,
And meet in heaven my Donor,
His faithful warrior.

Nothing so moves my pity
As seeing through these lands,
Field, village, town and city
Pillaged by roving hands.
O that the Spaniards rape thee,
My Netherlands so sweet,
The thought of that does grip me
Causing my heart to bleed.

A stride on steed of mettle
I've waited with my host
The tyrant's call to battle,
Who durst not do his boast.
For, near Maastricht ensconced,
He feared the force I wield.
My horsemen saw one bounce it
Bravely across the field.

Surely, if God had willed it,
When that fierce tempest blew,
My power would have stilled it,
Or turned its blast from you
But He who dwells in heaven,
Whence all our blessings flow,
For which aye praise be given,
Did not desire it so.

Steadfast my heart remaineth
In my adversity
My princely courage straineth
All nerves to live and be.
I've prayed the Lord my Master
With fervid heart and tense
To save me from disaster
And prove my innocence.

Alas! my flock. To sever
Is hard on us. Farewell.
Your Shepherd wakes, wherever
Dispersed you may dwell,
Pray God that He may ease you.
His Gospel be your cure.
Walk in the steps of Jesu
This life will not endure.

Unto the Lord His power
I do confession make
That ne'er at any hour
Ill of the King I spake.
But unto God, the greatest
Of Majesties I owe
Obedience first and latest,
For Justice wills it so.",God

Chorus

VII
Those monsters that carry with them
the infamous and servile character,
How can they ever compare
with the heroes of the fifth of April?
They serve the same tyrant
that, his law and his blood mocked...
for the country, we fight
our life loyalty and honor.

Chorus

VIII
By sea and land they threaten
the henchmen of the vile despot,
but all nature
awaits you to fight.
The Pacific, to the south and west,
to the east: the Andes and the sun,
to the north: an immense desert
and the center: freedom and union.

Chorus

IX
See the insignia with which, in Chacabuco,
you knew how to surrender the intruder,
and the august tricolor that, in Maipo,
on a day of triumph he gave us a thousand.
See him now, dominating an ocean
and, flaming over the fierce lion,
shudders at the sight of him, the Iberian,
our breasts inflame the courage.

Chorus

X
Citizens, glory presides,
of the homeland, the happy destiny,
and may, future ages,
their parents, thus bless. Adventurous a thousand times lives
with which Chile, its happiness strengthened...
if I remain a tyrant, his blood
of the heroes write the blazon.

Built on perpetual right;
May his crown ever dazzle our eye
Even more by virtue than gold!
Support the sceptre, which he bears,
Guide it in his hand;
Inspire, O God! Preserve the prince,
The prince and Fatherland.

Away! Away! Who forges plans
for one of them alone:
We feel, in weal and woe,
that country and king are one.
O God! Do not hear upon the call
of him who dares to separate them,
But listen to our common song
For Fatherland and prince.

This supplication enter your heaven

And us, his family

for freedom's sake my fathers died,
to that, to know it, point my colours.
Never will I trembling quail;
as they did, will I dare.
Be it a rainy day, be it cheerful sunshine,
I am a Prussian, want nothing but to be a Prussian.

2. With affection and loyalty I approach the throne,
from which gently a father talks to me;
and as the father is faithful to his son,
so will I be faithful to him and falter not.
The bonds of affection are firm.
Hail my fatherland!
The king's call penetrates my heart so deep:
I am a Prussian, want nothing but to be a Prussian.

3. Not every day may gleam with sunshine;
from time to time a cloud and shower nears.
But may never anybody read in my face
that all my wishes are not satisfied.
Although near and far
very many would like to change places with me,
their happiness is deceit and their freedom is illusion:
I am a Prussian, want nothing but to be a Prussian.

4. At times the evil storm roars around me,
the night burns in lightning's blaze;
even so, it has stormed worse in the world already,
and what didn't tremble was the Prussian courage.
May rock and oak tree shatter,
I will not tremble.
May it storm, may it thunder, may lightning strike wildly:
I am a Prussian, want nothing but to be a Prussian.

5. Where love and faithfulness devote themselves to the king in such way,
where king and people give each other their hand,
there has to prosper the people's true happiness,

Love and loyalty to the king!
Firm be that bond! Yes, bravely keep the bond:
For we are Prussians, let's be Prussians.

6. And we, who on the Baltic and North Sea shores,
were standing as guard, hardened by wave and wind,
we, who are since Düppel by a bond of blood
chained to Prussia's throne and people,
we will not backwards look,
no, forward with confidence!
We call forth to all the world about us
really we're Prussians, will be Prussians!

7. The Prussian's star can shine over a large distance brightly,
the Prussian's eagle can fly ahead of the clouds,
the Prussian standard is fresher than a sassafras wreath,
the Prussian sword to victories crushes a path.
And high on Prussia's throne
in the lustre of Frederick's crown
rule us our king, strong and mild,

Of a German and ancient line,
I dedicate undying
Faith to this land of mine.
A prince I am, undaunted,
Of Orange, ever free,
To the king of Spain I've granted
A lifelong loyalty.

I've ever tried to live in
The fear of God's command
And therefore I've been driven,
From people, home, and land,
But God, I trust, will rate me
His willing instrument
And one day reinstate me
Into my government.

Let no despair betray you,
My subjects true and good.
The Lord will surely stay you
Though now you are pursued.
He who would live devoutly
Must pray God day and night
To throw His power about me
As champion of your right.

Life and my all for others
I sacrificed, for you!
And my illustrious brothers
Proved their devotion too.
Count Adolf, more's the pity,
Fell in the Frisian fray,
And in the eternal city
Awaits the judgement day.

I, nobly born, descended
From an imperial stock.
An empire's prince, defended
(Braving the battle's shock
Heroically and fearless
As pious Christian ought)
With my life's blood the peerless
Gospel of God our Lord.

A shield and my reliance,
O God, Thou ever wert.
I'll trust unto Thy guidance.
O leave me not ungirt.
That I may stay a pious
Servant of Thine for aye
And drive the plagues that try us
And tyranny away.

My God, I pray thee, save me
From all who do pursue
And threaten to enslave me,
Thy trusted servant true.
O Father, do not sanction
Their wicked, foul design,
Don't let them wash their hands in
This guiltless blood of mine.

O David, thou soughtest shelter
From King Saul's tyranny.
Even so I fled this welter
And many a lord with me.
But God the Lord did save me
From exile and its hell
And, in His mercy, gave him
A realm in Israel.

Fear not 't will rain sans ceasing
The clouds are bound to part.
I bide that sight so pleasing
Unto my princely heart,
Which is that I with honor
Encounter death in war,
And meet in heaven my Donor,
His faithful warrior.

Nothing so moves my pity
As seeing through these lands,
Field, village, town and city
Pillaged by roving hands.
O that the Spaniards rape thee,
My Netherlands so sweet,
The thought of that does grip me
Causing my heart to bleed.

A stride on steed of mettle
I've waited with my host
The tyrant's call to battle,
Who durst not do his boast.
For, near Maastricht ensconced,
He feared the force I wield.
My horsemen saw one bounce it
Bravely across the field.

Surely, if God had willed it,
When that fierce tempest blew,
My power would have stilled it,
Or turned its blast from you
But He who dwells in heaven,
Whence all our blessings flow,
For which aye praise be given,
Did not desire it so.

Steadfast my heart remaineth
In my adversity
My princely courage straineth
All nerves to live and be.
I've prayed the Lord my Master
With fervid heart and tense
To save me from disaster
And prove my innocence.

Alas! my flock. To sever
Is hard on us. Farewell.
Your Shepherd wakes, wherever
Dispersed you may dwell,
Pray God that He may ease you.
His Gospel be your cure.
Walk in the steps of Jesu
This life will not endure.

Unto the Lord His power
I do confession make
That ne'er at any hour
Ill of the King I spake.
But unto God, the greatest
Of Majesties I owe
Obedience first and latest,
For Justice wills it so.",God
